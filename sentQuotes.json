  "The only way out is through.",
  "Your mind is a powerful thing. When you fill it with positive thoughts, your life will start to change.",
  "The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself as to why you canâ€™t achieve it.",
  "Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.",
  "Every storm runs out of rain.",
  "What consumes your mind, controls your life."
